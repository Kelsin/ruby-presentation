# Ruby Presentation

This is just a latex beamer presentation about ruby that I gave to my
co-workers. Feel free to send any thoughts/improvements as pull requests.

## Requirements

I'm using the current [MacTeX distribution](http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/)
which includes pdflatex (what I use in my Makefile) and the beamer packages. I'm
not a TeX export so I don't know if there are any other requirements that should
be listed. For me the normal MacTeX install worked great.
